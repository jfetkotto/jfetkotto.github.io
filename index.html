      <h1 id="jfetkottogithubio">About Me</h1>


      <p>I really like electronics and building things.</p>

      <p>Like many people who are into electronics, I started taking computers apart in my early teens out of curiosity. This sparked an interest in programming languages and I taught myself xyz. I played around with xyz, building fun projects like shoot 'em up games and yxz.</p>
      
      <p>Despite having no A Levels and I was convinced that I wanted to study electronics at university. Working part time to support myself, I completed a Foundation Year in XYZ. I then received an unconditional offer to study Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Westminster University as a first-generation university student in my family. Unfortunately, an unexpected and very sudden family bereavement in my final year meant I left university. I worked elsewhere for the next decade, but pursued electronics projects in my spare time.</p>
      
      <p>In 2017, I returned to study as a mature student. Even after a decade, my outstanding grades at Westminster meant my lecturer not only remembered me, but kindly wrote me a glowing reference. I graduated from London South Bank University with a First Class honours degree and the School of Engineering's Award for Integrity.</p>
      
      <p>I am now actively searching for the right job in xyz fields, with a focus on XYZ things.</p>
      
      <p>My CV is available to download in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code> formats.</p>
