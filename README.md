# jfetkotto.github.io

This is a public GitHub Pages page which I use to host my CV. It is built using a free theme (why over-engineer an existing solution?) and customised to meet my needs. 

My CV is available to download in `.docx` and `.pdf` formats. 

All contact details are available [on the page](jfetkotto.github.io).
